# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct to foster an open,
welcoming, and harassment-free community.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening
an issue or contacting the maintainers. Reports will be handled promptly and
fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers may take the following actions, depending on the severity:

1. Correction: A private, written warning with a request to stop the behavior.
2. Warning: A formal warning for continued or serious misconduct.
3. Temporary Ban: A time-limited ban from project participation.
4. Permanent Ban: Removal from the project for repeated or severe violations.
